I'm Jason Smith, and I'm a child of two famous stars: Star Trek and Star Wars. For the past ten years, I've led an unremarkable career in software testing and an unremarkable life. It often happens that my mind, being addicted to Star Trek and Star Wars, embellishes ideas for simple software utilities into massive, imaginary systems; I'm a dreamer. I enjoy tinkering with these embellished ideas once in a while, sketching out database schemas or class hierarchies. Sometimes I'll even write some code, but this is as far as I've ever ventured. I often wonder why we remain mired in mice and windows rather than revelling in advanced user interfaces like those we see in movies today. I've often thought about getting involved in social media, but a fear of horrible and imperfect writing instantly squashes these impulses.

Recently, I've been pondering my life: my gifts and talents, my destiny, and my current position in my personal state diagram. I'm realizing that fear of imperfection has significantly impeded my life. After ten years I'm stagnant; the pot needs stirred.

As a limited jack of all trades and master of none, I am certainly capable of succeeding as a software tester, yet I am certainly a padawan, a student. This blog then is my attempt to reinvigorate my life and career; a journey towards becoming a better jack of all trades and a master of something.

If your life-pot needs stirring as well then I welcome you to join me in this journey!

Sincerely,

Jason Smith
