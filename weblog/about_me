I'm Jason Smith, and I'm a child of two famous stars: Star Trek and Star Wars. For the past ten years, I've led an unremarkable career in software testing and an unremarkable life. I have enough skill to write simple utilities to automate frequent chores. It often happens that my brain, being hooked on Star Trek and Star Wars, embellishes these simple utilities into massive, imaginary systems. I enjoy tinkering with these embellished ideas once in a while, sketching out database schemas or class hierarchies. Sometimes I'll even write some code, but this is as far as I've ever ventured. I've often thought about writing and getting involved in social media, but a fear of horrible writing instantly squashes these impulses.

Recently, I've been pondering my life: my gifts and talents, my destiny, and my current position in my personal state diagram. After ten years I'm stagnant; the pot needs stirred.

As a limited jack of all trades and certainly a master of none, I am most certainly a padawan, a student. This blog then will document my adventure; my personal journey towards becoming a better jack of all trades and a master of something.

I've a few personal quirks that this blog may improve. I've always been able to express my thoughts better in writing than verbally, and I've always been able to understand written discussion better than verbal discussion. These personal quirks boil down to understanding; understanding the basics. This blog then, will also focus on the absolute basics, the core concepts, of programming languages and computer technologies. I hope to improve my writing as well by writing for this blog.

If you desire to learn new skills or improve your current skills then I welcome you to join me in this adventure!

Sincerely,

Jason Smith
